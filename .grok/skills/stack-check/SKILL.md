  USE WHEN the `stack-freshness` SessionStart hook nudges
  ("stack last checked 42d ago"), or when user asks to check dep
  versions. Verifies Claude Code + Codex + plugin + CLI deps vs
  `stack.toml` (per-OS update commands), flags stale
  AIDEV-TODO/QUESTION anchors (deadline-aware), and sanity-checks
  AGENTS.md size + imports. Read-only. Resets the freshness timestamp.

# /stack-check

## What it does

Walks `stack.toml`, queries each declared dependency's installed version,
optionally fetches the latest available version, and reports a Markdown
table:

```markdown
# Stack check — <YYYY-MM-DD>

| Tool | Installed | Required | Status | Update |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| claude (Claude Code) | 2.1.89 | ≥2.1.0 | ok | — |
| codex (Codex CLI) | 0.39.0 | ≥0.40.0 | **outdated** | npm i -g @openai/codex |
| claude-leverage (this plugin) | 1.0.0 | latest 1.0.1 | **outdated** | /plugin update claude-leverage |
| git | 2.45.0 | ≥2.40.0 | ok | — |
| rg | 14.0.3 | ≥13.0.0 | ok | — |
| jq | (not found) | ≥1.6 (optional) | missing | brew install jq |
| python | 3.12.1 | ≥3.10 | ok | — |
| mmdc | (not found) | ≥10.0.0 (optional) | missing | npm i -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli |
| node | 20.10.0 | ≥20.0.0 | ok | — |
| shellcheck | (not found) | ≥0.8.0 (optional) | missing | brew install shellcheck |
```

On successful completion (no errors thrown), updates
`GROK_HOME/claude-profile/claude-leverage/.last-stack-check` (X:\Grok_Build\.grok\claude-profile\...)
with the current epoch time so the SessionStart hook stays quiet for the next N days.

## Workflow

1. **Load `stack.toml`.** From the plugin install dir
   (`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/stack.toml`) or, if running standalone, from the
   repo root. If neither exists, STOP and report.

2. **For each `[[host.tool]]` and `[[deps.tool]]`:**
   - Run `check_cmd`. Capture stdout+stderr.
   - Parse the version with a simple regex (`(\d+\.\d+(\.\d+)?)` —
     accept "X.Y" and "X.Y.Z" both). If parse fails or command not
     found, mark "missing" (and "outdated" if `optional = false`).
   - Compare against `min_version` using a tuple compare (split on `.`).
   - Mark: `ok` | `outdated` | `missing` | `unknown (parse failed)`.
   - **Resolve update hint** per-OS: detect platform via `uname -s` (or
     PowerShell `$env:OS` / `$IsWindows`). Prefer `update_hint_macos` /
     `update_hint_linux` / `update_hint_windows` when present and the
     platform matches; otherwise fall back to the generic `update_hint`
     field. This is what stack.toml `manifest_version = 2` introduced.

3. **For the plugin itself:**
   - Read `version` from the installed `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
   - WebFetch
     `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Filip-Podstavec/claude-leverage/main/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
     and compare to the installed version. Cache the network result for
     24h in `GROK_HOME/claude-profile/claude-leverage/.stack-check-cache.json` to avoid
     hammering GitHub if the user runs the skill repeatedly.

4. **For Claude Code itself:**
   - `claude --version` is the installed version.
   - We do NOT fetch the latest Claude Code version from the network —
     Anthropic doesn't expose a stable scrapable endpoint. Instead, the
     `min_version` in stack.toml is hand-maintained: bump it when this
     plugin starts depending on a feature only present in a newer CC.

5. **Walk the current repo for AIDEV anchor health** (if cwd is inside
   a git repo). Grep `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` for
   `AIDEV-(TODO|QUESTION)` matches and parse each line.

   Two flavors of anchor:
   - **Deadline-bearing**: `AIDEV-TODO(by: 2026-08-01):` or
     `AIDEV-QUESTION(by: YYYY-MM-DD):`. Extract the ISO-8601 date and
     compare against today.
     - `due-soon` (deadline in the next 14 days)
     - `overdue` (deadline already passed)
   - **Age-based** (no deadline): use `git log -1 --format=%cI -- <file>`
     for the file's last-modified timestamp.
     - `fresh` (≤30 days)
     - `aging` (30–90 days)
     - `stale` (>90 days)

   Cap walk at 5000 files; skip the bench archive, vendor dirs,
   node_modules, __pycache__, .git.

   Reported after the version table:

   ```markdown
   ## AIDEV anchors (current repo: <name>)

   - 14 AIDEV-TODO total: 3 fresh, 8 aging, 2 stale (>90d), **1 overdue (by deadline)**
   - 5 AIDEV-QUESTION total: 1 fresh, 2 aging, 1 stale, 1 due-soon

   **Overdue (deadline passed):**
   - `src/billing/charge.py:47` — AIDEV-TODO due 2026-04-01 (44 days overdue)
     "replace the polling loop with webhooks"

   **Due soon (next 14 days):**
   - `src/auth/middleware.py:89` — AIDEV-QUESTION due 2026-06-05 (in 12 days)

   **Stale (no deadline, last touched >90 days ago):**
   - `src/legacy/handlers.py:120` — AIDEV-TODO (last touched 2025-12-03)
     "migrate to v2 API"
   ```

   If not in a git repo, skip this section silently.

   Deadline parsing tolerates a few formats. The distinguishing rule
   for implementors: the parenthesized content matches one of these
   regexes (anchored, case-insensitive on the keyword):
   - `^by:\s*(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})$`         — `(by: 2026-08-01)`
   - `^(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})$`               — `(2026-08-01)` (bare ISO date)
   - `^deadline:\s*(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})$`   — `(deadline: 2026-08-01)`

   Anything else in the parens (free-form notes like `(Q3 2026)` or
   `(after the migration)`) is NOT a deadline; that anchor falls under
   age-based stale tracking. This prevents misclassifying ambiguous
   parenthetical text as a date.

6. **Sanity-check AGENTS.md** (if present in cwd or repo root):
   - File size, two tiers (report the size either way):
     - **warn over 8 KiB** — lean target exceeded; an always-loaded file
       this large dilutes attention. Suggest extracting topic depth to
       `docs/` behind a when-to-read link.
     - **flag over 32 KiB** — Codex caps the assembled project doc at
       `project_doc.max_bytes` (default 32768) and silently drops the rest,
       so content past that byte is invisible to Codex agents.
     Both tiers are advisory here and do not stop the timestamp reset (step
     9). `/repo-doctor` escalates the 32 KiB tier to a hard ❌ — that split
     is intentional (see ADR 0009): `/stack-check` informs, `/repo-doctor`
     gates.
   - Broken `@<path>` imports: grep for `^@` lines, verify each
     referenced file exists relative to the importer.
   - Stale file references: extract `path/to/file.ext`-shaped strings
     from the body and check existence (best-effort; lots of false
     positives, so report only the obvious ones — e.g. when AGENTS.md
     mentions `scripts/foo.sh` and `scripts/foo.sh` does not exist).
   Per-directory AGENTS.md files (`**/AGENTS.md`, depth ≤ 3) get the same
   two-tier size check — and they share the same ~32 KiB Codex budget as the
   root file, so a large root plus several per-dir files can truncate even
   when no single file exceeds the cap.

   Reported after the anchors section:

   ```markdown
   ## AGENTS.md sanity

   - `AGENTS.md` — 11.3 KiB, **over 8 KiB lean target** (extract topic
     depth to `docs/` behind a when-to-read link)
   - `src/billing/AGENTS.md` — 1.1 KiB, ok
   - `src/api/AGENTS.md` — **38.4 KiB, over Codex 32 KiB cap** (Codex
     will silently drop content beyond byte 32768; split it)
   - Broken imports: _none_
   - Possibly stale references: 1 (`scripts/old_runner.sh` mentioned
     but not found)
   ```

7. **Walk every tracked `*.md` file for stale path references.** This
   is the generalization of step 6's "Possibly stale references" check
   beyond AGENTS.md — the failure mode "doc references a file that was
   moved or deleted N versions ago" is repo-wide, not AGENTS.md-only.

   Scope:
   - Use `git ls-files '*.md'` so untracked / .gitignored markdown is
     not scanned. Skip files under the bench archive, `node_modules/`,
     `vendor/`, `__pycache__/`, `.git/`, and anything inside a
     `.gitignored` tree (relying on `ls-files` filters most of this).
   - Cap walk at the first 200 markdown files (sorted) — repos with
     larger doc trees get a "(truncated)" footer; honest scope, not a
     silent half-job.

   Per file:
   - Strip fenced code blocks (` ``` ... ``` `) and inline backticks
     before regex-walking the body. Path-like tokens inside code blocks
     are usually placeholders / examples, not live links.
   - Extract candidates with a deliberately conservative regex (rough
     shape, implementor adjusts):
     `(?:^|[\s(\[`>])([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_.\-]*(?:/[a-zA-Z0-9_.\-]+)+\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+)(?:$|[\s.,;:)`\]])`
     — must contain at least one `/`, must end in a file extension, must
     not look like a URL (skip if preceded by `://` or starting with
     `http`).
   - Skip tokens that look like commit hashes, version strings
     (`v1.2.3`), or domain names (anything matching `\.(com|org|io|dev|gov)$`).
   - Resolve relative to the repo root (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`).
     If the file does not exist, record `<md-file>:<line> → <token>`.

   Output budget: hard cap of 20 broken refs in the report; if more,
   show the first 20 plus a "(N more not shown)" footer so the section
   does not dominate the report.

   Reported as a new section:

   ```markdown
   ## Markdown link audit

   Scanned 47 tracked `*.md` files; 3 broken path references.

   - `README.md:118` → `scripts/legacy/runner.sh` (not found)
   - `docs/adr/0002-...md:42` → `agents/old-reviewer.md` (not found)
   - `workflows/security-first-feature.md:88` → `templates/old-logging.md` (not found)
   ```

   If zero broken refs, write `_All links resolve._` and move on. If
   the scan was skipped (not in a git repo, or `CLAUDE_LEVERAGE_SKIP_MD_LINK_AUDIT=1`),
   omit the section entirely.

   This check exists because the v1.0.0 → v1.3.3 pivot in this repo
   left three stale `tests/README.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `ci.yml` refs
   that survived 4–7 version bumps before being caught by a human-led
   pre-push audit. Catching that class of drift automatically is the
   point.

8. **Emit the Markdown report** combining version table + anchors +
   AGENTS.md sanity + markdown link audit. Tier the version rows:
   required first, then optional. Required-failing rows in bold.

9. **Reset the timestamp.** Only if no row failed with an *error*
   (process crashed, network exception). A failure status (outdated /
   missing / stale anchors / oversized AGENTS.md) is information, not
   an error — reset the timestamp.

   **Run exactly this command — do NOT write a literal number into the
   file:**

   ```bash
   date +%s > "$STATE_DIR/.last-stack-check"
   ```

   where `$STATE_DIR` is `${CLAUDE_LEVERAGE_STATE_DIR:-${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/claude-leverage}`
   (matching the fallback chain in `scripts/hooks/stack-freshness.sh`).
   The SessionStart hook reads the epoch from the file body — not the
   mtime — so a stale or hallucinated number suppresses nudges for
   weeks. Capturing the value via `date +%s` is the only reliable way
   to avoid the v1.4.0 field-feedback #7 bug where the body and mtime
   disagreed by ~2 months.

## Hard rules

- **Never install anything.** Output update commands, but never run
  them. The user types whichever they want.
- **Never block.** Read-only network + filesystem.
- **Cache network results for 24h.** If the cache file exists and is
  fresh, use it without hitting the network. Cache key: the
  fully-resolved marketplace.json URL.
- **Network is optional.** If WebFetch fails (offline), report
  "(cannot fetch latest — offline)" for the rows that need network and
  keep the rest of the report.
- **Always run `Bash(... --version)` defensively.** Use `2>&1` and treat
  exit code != 0 OR empty output as "not found".

## Tunables

- `CLAUDE_LEVERAGE_FRESHNESS_DAYS=N` — override the 30-day default for
  the SessionStart hook.
- `CLAUDE_LEVERAGE_FRESHNESS_DAYS=0` — disable the SessionStart nudge
  entirely.
- `CLAUDE_LEVERAGE_STATE_DIR=<path>` — override the state directory.
- `CLAUDE_LEVERAGE_ANCHOR_STALE_DAYS=N` — change the "stale" threshold
  for AIDEV-TODO/QUESTION (default 90).
- `CLAUDE_LEVERAGE_SKIP_ANCHOR_AUDIT=1` — skip the AIDEV anchor walk
  entirely (useful when running outside any project repo).
- `CLAUDE_LEVERAGE_SKIP_AGENTS_MD_AUDIT=1` — skip the AGENTS.md
  sanity pass.
- `CLAUDE_LEVERAGE_SKIP_MD_LINK_AUDIT=1` — skip the repo-wide markdown
  link audit (step 7). Use when the repo has a very large doc tree
  and the audit is producing too many false positives to be useful.

## Codex parity

Same SKILL.md ships in Codex via `scripts/install-codex.sh`. The skill
checks Codex's own version too (if `codex` is on PATH); the row is
optional so a Claude-only user doesn't see a false missing.

## What this skill does NOT do

- **Install or update anything.** Suggest commands; let the user run
  them.
- **Check arbitrary user-installed plugins.** Scope is limited to this
  plugin's own stack. Policing every other plugin's freshness is scope
  creep with bad failure modes (marketplaces change shape, plugins
  uninstall, etc.).
- **Telemetry / phone-home.** All state is local. Only network calls
  are to public GitHub and (optionally) npm registry for plugin/codex
  latest-version lookup, and only when the user explicitly runs this
  skill.
